Dry-Ice-Climber
===============

A vertical scroller about climbing a mountain of solid carbon dioxide.
Fun, eh?

Note to the programmers:
- If you want to update the sprites, first edit/replace the image files as usual, then do a "clean & build" in Netbeans so that the new images will appear when you click run.
- The same goes if you want to create a new .jar file.
